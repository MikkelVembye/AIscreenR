\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataset containing the titles and abstracts.}

\item{prompt}{Prompt(s) to be added before the title and abstract.}

\item{studyid}{Unique Study ID. If missing, this is generated
automatically.}

\item{title}{Name of the variable containing the title information.}

\item{abstract}{Name of variable containing the abstract information.}

\item{...}{Further argument to pass to the request body.}

\item{model}{Character string with the name of the completion model. Can take
multiple Groq models. Default = \code{"llama3-70b-8192"}.
Find available models at \url{https://console.groq.com/docs/models}.}

\item{role}{Character string indicate the role of the user. Default is \code{"user"}.}

\item{tools}{List of function definitions for tool calling. Default behavior is set based on \code{decision_description} parameter.
For detailed responses, the function uses tools that include detailed description capabilities.}

\item{tool_choice}{Specification for which tool to use. Default behavior is set based on \code{decision_description} parameter.
For simple responses uses "inclusion_decision_simple", for detailed responses uses "inclusion_decision".}

\item{top_p}{'An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling,
where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10\% probability mass are considered.
We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.' (Groq). Default is 1.}

\item{time_info}{Logical indicating whether the run time of each
request/question should be included in the data. Default = \code{TRUE}.}

\item{token_info}{Logical indicating whether the number of prompt and completion tokens
per request should be included in the output data. Default = \code{TRUE}. When \code{TRUE},
the output object will include price information of the conducted screening.}

\item{api_key}{Numerical value with your personal API key. Find at
\url{https://console.groq.com/keys}. Set with
\code{Sys.setenv(GROQ_KEY = "your-api-key")} or use \code{\link[=get_api_key_groq]{get_api_key_groq()}}.}

\item{max_tries, max_seconds}{'Cap the maximum number of attempts with
\code{max_tries} or the total elapsed time from the first request with
\code{max_seconds}. If neither option is supplied (the default), \code{\link[httr2:req_perform]{httr2::req_perform()}}
will not retry'.}

\item{is_transient}{'A predicate function that takes a single argument
(the response) and returns \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} specifying whether or not
the response represents a transient error'.}

\item{backoff}{'A function that takes a single argument (the number of failed
attempts so far) and returns the number of seconds to wait'.}

\item{after}{'A function that takes a single argument (the response) and
returns either a number of seconds to wait or \code{NULL}, which indicates
that a precise wait time is not available that the \code{backoff} strategy
should be used instead'.}

\item{rpm}{Numerical value indicating the number of requests per minute (rpm)
available for the specified api key.}

\item{reps}{Numerical value indicating the number of times the same
question should be sent to Groq's API models. This can be useful to test consistency
between answers. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{seed_par}{Numerical value for a seed to ensure that proper,
parallel-safe random numbers are produced.}

of decisions. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{messages}{Logical indicating whether to print messages embedded in the function.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{incl_cutoff_upper}{Numerical value indicating the probability threshold
for which a studies should be included. Default is 0.5, which indicates that
titles and abstracts that Groq's API model has included more than 50 percent of the times
should be included.}

\item{incl_cutoff_lower}{Numerical value indicating the probability threshold
above which studies should be check by a human. Default is 0.4, which means
that if you ask Groq's API model the same questions 10 times and it includes the
title and abstract 4 times, we suggest that the study should be check by a human.}

\item{force}{Logical argument indicating whether to force the function to use more than
10 iterations. This argument is developed to avoid the conduct of wrong and extreme sized screening.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"groq"}. The object is a list containing the following
components:
\item{answer_data_aggregated}{dataset with the summarized, probabilistic inclusion decision
for each title and abstract across multiple repeated questions (only when reps > 1).}
\item{answer_data}{dataset with all individual answers.}
\item{price_dollar}{numerical value indicating the total price (in USD) of the screening.}
\item{price_data}{dataset with prices across all models used for screening.}
\item{error_data}{dataset with failed requests (only included if errors occurred).}
\item{run_date}{date when the screening was conducted.}
}
\description{
This function supports the conduct of title and abstract screening with Groq API models in R.
Specifically, it allows the user to draw on Groq-hosted models (e.g., Llama 3 / 3.1 variants, Mixtral/Mistral, Gemma, DeepSeek, Qwen, and fine-tuned models).
The function allows to run title and abstract screening across multiple prompts and with
repeated questions to check for consistency across answers. All of which can be done in parallel.
The function draws on the newly developed function calling which is called via the
tools argument in the request body. This is the main different between \code{\link[=tabscreen_gpt.tools]{tabscreen_gpt.tools()}}
and \code{\link[=tabscreen_gpt.original]{tabscreen_gpt.original()}}. Function calls ensure more reliable and consistent responses to ones
requests. See \href{https://osf.io/preprints/osf/yrhzm}{Vembye, Christensen, MÃ¸lgaard, and Schytt. (2025)}
for guidance on how adequately to conduct title and abstract screening with Groq models.
