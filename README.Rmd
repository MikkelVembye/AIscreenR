# AIscreenR: AI screening tools in R for systematic reviewing 

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/MikkelVembye/AIscreenR/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MikkelVembye/AIscreenR/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AIscreenR is to use AI tools to support screening processes (including title and abstract screening) in systematic reviews and related literature reviews. At the current stage, the main aim of the `AIscreenR` package is to support the use and testing of OpenAI's GPT API models as the second screeners of titles and abstracts or alternatively to reduce research waste, i.e., the number of references needed to be screened by humans. The package allows user to apply OpenAI's GPT API models from the [https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) endpoint. In future developments, we expect to add further LLMs when APIs become available for other models, for example from Claude 2. For now, we invite other researchers to test this software so that we as a review community can get a better understanding of the performance of OpenAI's GPT API models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of AIscreenR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MikkelVembye/AIscreenR")

```

Setting API key and checking rate limits
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Find your api key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 
# Thereafter, either encrypt it with the secret functions from the httr2 package
# see https://httr2.r-lib.org/reference/secrets.html or run set_api_key() 
# and then enter you key.
library(AIscreenR)
library(revtools)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(future)

# Setting API
set_api_key(AIscreenR:::testing_key_chatgpt())

# Obtain rate limits info (Default is "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613")
rate_limits <- rate_limits_per_minute()
rate_limits

# Obtain rate limits info across multiple models
rate_limits <- rate_limits_per_minute(model = c("gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "gpt-4"))
rate_limits

```

How to load ris files. In this example we have downloaded the ris files from 
the [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/EPPIReviewer-Web/home). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Loading ris file data via revtools
ris_dat_excl <- revtools::read_bibliography("path/FFT_exclude.ris") |> 
  suppressWarnings() |> 
  select(studyid = eppi_id, title, abstract) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(
    human_code = 0 # Indicating exclusion
  )

ris_dat_incl <- revtools::read_bibliography("path/FFT_include.ris") |> 
  suppressWarnings() |> 
  select(studyid = eppi_id, title, abstract) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(
    human_code = 1 # Indicating inclusion
  )

filges2015_dat<- bind_rows(ris_dat_excl, ris_dat_incl)
head(filges2015_dat, 10)
#> # A tibble: 10 × 4

Example of how to enter a prompt. Can also be done in word (see vignette).

```{r}
prompt <- "Evaluate the following study based on the selection criteria
for a systematic review on the effects of family-based interventions on drug abuse
reduction for young people in treatment for non-opioid drug use.
A family-based intervention (FFT) is equivalent to a behavior focused
family therapy, where young people’s drug use is understood in relation to family
behavior problems. Family-based interventions also includes manual-based family therapies as
it targets young people and their families as a system throughout treatment, and thereby recognizes
the important role of the family system in the development and treatment of young people’s drug use
problems. FFT was developed in the late 1980s on request from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA). The development of FFT was initially heavily inspired by the alcohol abuse program
Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), which was aimed at restructuring the environment
to reinforce non-alcohol associated activities. FFT developed to have more emphasis on
contingency contracting, impulse control strategies specific to drug use,
and increased emphasis on involvement of family members in treatment.
FFT is designed to accommodate diverse populations of youths with a variety of behavioral,
cultural and individual preferences. FFT has evolved for use in severe behavioral disturbances
known to co-exist with substance use and dependence, and the core interventions
have been enhanced to address several mental health related problems commonly occurring
as comorbid conditions in drug use treatment participant.  For each study,
I would like you to assess:  1) Is the study about a family-based intervention,
such as Functional Family Therapy, Multidimensional Family Therapy, or
Behavioral Family Therapy? (Outpatient manual-based interventions of any
duration delivered to young people and their families). If not, exclude study.
2) Are the participants in outpatient drug treatment primarily
for non-opioid drug use? 3) Are the participants within age 11–21?"

Approximate price of screening

```{r}
app_obj <- 
  approximate_price_gpt(
    data = filges2015_dat,
    prompt = prompt,
    studyid = studyid, # indicate the variable with the studyid in the data
    title = title, # indicate the variable with the titles in the data
    abstract = abstract, # indicate the variable with the abstracts in the data
    model = "gpt-4o",
    rep = 10 
  )

app_obj

app_obj$price_dollar
app_obj$price_data

```

Example of how to conduct simple screening, getting return 1 if a reference should be included,
0 if excluded, and 1.1 if a firm decision cannot be reached. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# Subsetting the number of references to speed up the tutorial screening
plan(multisession)
test_obj <- 
  tabscreen_gpt(
    data = filges2015_dat[c(1:5, 266:270),],
    prompt = prompt, 
    studyid = studyid, # indicate the variable with the studyid in the data
    title = title, # indicate the variable with the titles in the data
    abstract = abstract, # indicate the variable with the abstracts in the data
    model = "gpt-4o",
    reps = 1 # Number of times the same question is asked to ChatGPT
  ) 
plan(sequential)
test_obj

# Data sets in object
price_dat <- test_obj$price_data
price_dat


all_dat <- test_obj$answer_data
all_dat |> select(human_code, decision_binary)
