The program was  #> based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and was informed by similar universal  #> programs (i.e., the Fun FRIENDS program; Barrett, 2007a, 2007b). Methods: Seventy-four  #> children from a single school were allocated to an intervention or control group.  #> The intervention comprised 10 CBT sessions, and assessments were conducted before  #> and after the program. The primary outcome measure was the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) #> as children's self-report. Secondary outcome measures were the Depression Self-Rating  #> Scale for Children (DSRS-C), Children's Hope Scale (Hope),  #> Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent Version (SCAS-P), and Strengths  #> and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent Version (SDQ-P). Results:  The SCAS as the  #> primary outcome showed no significant differences between the two groups. #> In addition, DSRS-C, Hope and SDQ-P also showed no significant differences.  #> SCAS-P in the intervention group showed significant decrease compared to those  #> in the control group.

A family-based intervention (FFT) is equivalent to a behavior focused  family therapy, where young people’s drug use is understood in relation to family  behavior problems. Family-based interventions also includes manual-based family therapies as  it targets young people and their families as a system throughout treatment, and thereby recognizes  the important role of the family system in the development and treatment of young people’s drug use  problems. FFT was developed in the late 1980s on request from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse  (NIDA). The development of FFT was initially heavily inspired by the alcohol abuse program  Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), which was aimed at restructuring the environment  to reinforce non-alcohol associated activities. FFT developed to have more emphasis on  contingency contracting, impulse control strategies specific to drug use,  and increased emphasis on involvement of family members in treatment.  FFT is designed to accommodate diverse populations of youths with a variety of behavioral,  cultural and individual preferences. FFT has evolved for use in severe behavioral disturbances  known to co-exist with substance use and dependence, and the core interventions  have been enhanced to address several mental health related problems commonly occurring  as comorbid conditions in drug use treatment participant.  For each study,  I would like you to assess:  1) Is the study about a family-based intervention,  such as Functional Family Therapy, Multidimensional Family Therapy, or  Behavioral Family Therapy? (Outpatient manual-based interventions of any  duration delivered to young people and their families). If not, exclude study.  2) Are the participants in outpatient drug treatment primarily  for non-opioid drug use? 3) Are the participants within age 11–21?\" app_obj <-    approximate_price_gpt(     data = filges2015_dat,     prompt = prompt,     studyid = studyid, # indicate the variable with the studyid in the data     title = title, # indicate the variable with the titles in the data     abstract = abstract, # indicate the variable with the abstracts in the data     model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",     rep = 1    )  app_obj #> The approximate price of the (simple) screening will be around $0.0476.  app_obj$price_dollar #> [1] 0.0476 app_obj$price_data #> # A tibble: 1 × 6 #>   prompt   model       iterations input_price_dollar output_price_dollar #>   <chr>    <chr>            <dbl>              <dbl>               <dbl> #> 1 Prompt 1 gpt-4o-mini          1             0.0458             0.00178 #> # ℹ 1 more variable: total_price_dollar <dbl> # Subsetting the number of references to speed up the tutorial screening plan(multisession) test_obj <-    tabscreen_gpt(     data = filges2015_dat[c(1:5, 266:270),],     prompt = prompt,      studyid = studyid, # indicate the variable with the studyid in the data     title = title, # indicate the variable with the titles in the data     abstract = abstract, # indicate the variable with the abstracts in the data     model = \"gpt-4o-mini\",     reps = 1 # Number of times the same question is asked to ChatGPT   )  #> * The approximate price of the current (simple) screening will be around $0.0017. #> * Consider removing references without abstracts since these can distort the accuracy of the screening. #> Progress: ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 100% plan(sequential) test_obj #>  #> Find the final result dataset via result_object$answer_data  # Data sets in object price_dat <- test_obj$price_data price_dat #> # A tibble: 1 × 6 #>   prompt model       iterations input_price_dollar output_price_dollar #>    <int> <chr>            <dbl>              <dbl>               <dbl> #> 1      1 gpt-4o-mini          1             0.0016           0.0000432 #> # ℹ 1 more variable: total_price_dollar <dbl>  all_dat <- test_obj$answer_data all_dat |> select(human_code, decision_binary) #> # A tibble: 10 × 2 #>    human_code decision_binary #>         <dbl>           <dbl> #>  1          0               0 #>  2          0               0 #>  3          0               0 #>  4          0               0 #>  5          0               0 #>  6          1               0 #>  7          1               1 #>  8          1               0 #>  9          1               1 #> 10          1               1"},{"path":"https://mikkelvembye.github.io/AIscreenR/reference/AIscreenR-package.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"AIscreenR: AI Screening Tools in R for Systematic Reviewing — AIscreenR-package","title":"AIscreenR: AI Screening Tools in R for Systematic Reviewing — AIscreenR-package","text":"Provides functions conduct title abstract screening systematic reviews using large language models, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models 'OpenAI' https://platform.openai.com/. functions can enhance quality title abstract screenings reducing total screening time significantly. addition, package includes tools quality assessment title abstract screenings, described Vembye, Christensen, Mølgaard, Schytt (2024) doi:10.31219/osf.io/yrhzm .","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://mikkelvembye.github.io/AIscreenR/reference/AIscreenR-package.html","id":"author","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Author","title":"AIscreenR: AI Screening Tools in R for Systematic Reviewing — AIscreenR-package","text":"Maintainer: Mikkel H.
