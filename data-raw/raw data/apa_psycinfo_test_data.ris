AB  - The preschool-to-third grade perspective has helped the early childhood field move away from a reliance on relatively brief or one-shot programs toward more systematic and comprehensive models that span most of children's first decade. We review the knowledge base on the effectiveness of preschool-to-third grade intervention programs and practices for young children making the transition to school. Our coverage includes extended early childhood interventions, preschool programs, full-day kindergarten, reduced class sizes in the early grades, parent involvement, instructional practices, and school transitions (mobility). We distinguish between two major PK-3 strategies. PK-3 programs are planned interventions that begin during any of the five years of a child's life before kindergarten and which continue up to third grade. The most comprehensive programs include all these elements, and serve children from low-income families or who have special needs. Alternatively, PK-3 practices are defined as specific elements or components of extended early childhood programs that are hypothesized to be associated with children's outcomes. These elements may include preschool education, full-day kindergarten, reduced class sizes, teaching practices, and parent involvement activities. Overall, we find growing evidence for the positive effects of PK-3 programs and practices. The strongest evidence supporting enduring effects into adulthood is from center-based preschool programs followed by small classes in the early grades. Additional longitudinal studies are needed into adulthood to fully document the effects of different PK-3 programs and to verify the extent to which PK-3 practices (e.g., parent involvement, school mobility) have long-term effects into adulthood.

AB  - Behavioral interventions based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) have been demonstrated to reduce HIV risk behavior among mid- and older adolescents in different settings across the globe but have not been evaluated among Caribbean nations and have received limited evaluation among pre-adolescents. To determine (1) the effectiveness among pre-adolescents in The Bahamas of a PMT-based HIV prevention program "Focus on Youth in the Caribbean" (FOYC) and (2) the role of the targeted PMT constructs in intervention effect. 1,360 sixth grade youth (10–11 years of age) from 15 urban schools in New Providence, The Bahamas were randomized by school to receive either FOYC or a control condition. Data collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months post intervention were analyzed. A five-step scheme was used to assess sexual behavior progression, ranging from "1" = "a virgin without intention to have sex"to "5" = "having sex without a condom". Group-based trajectory analysis was utilized in assessing the program effect. Two sexual behavior progression patterns were detected: slow progressors and quick progressors. Receiving FOYC reduced the likelihood for adolescents to become quick progressors (adjusted OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64–1.00). The observed effectiveness was especially impacted by a subset of the targeted PMT constructs. FOYC effectively delays sexual risk among Bahamian preadolescents. The group-based trajectory analysis provides an analytical approach for assessing interventions among adolescents with low rates and diverse progression patterns of sexual activity.

AB  - Entry-level kindergartners in classrooms from five middle class school districts were given a test of letter identification and children who scored at or below the 30th percentile on the test were classified as "at risk" for early reading difficulties. Half of these children were randomly assigned to a project-based intervention condition where they received supplementary intervention in small groups until the end of their kindergarten year. The other half received whatever remedial services were available at their home schools and literacy skills development in both groups was tracked throughout kindergarten. All available at-risk children were again assessed at the beginning of first grade and dichotomized into a "continued-risk" group and a "no-longer-at-risk" group using a composite measure of basic word level skills. Normal reader controls were also identified using the same measure. Children in the continued-risk group received either project-based intervention (one-to-one tutoring 30 min daily) or school-based intervention throughout first grade. Intervention for project treatment children was discontinued at the end of first grade and literacy development in all groups was tracked until the end of third grade. The present study focused on literacy development in children who received only project-based kindergarten intervention or both (project-based) kindergarten and first grade intervention, relative to the normal reader controls. Of special interest was the question of whether measures of response to intervention would more effectively distinguish between continued-risk and no-longer-at-risk children than would kindergarten screening measures, measures of intelligence, or measures of reading-related cognitive abilities. Results indicated that the RTI measures more effectively and more consistently distinguished between these two groups than did the psychometric measures.

AB  - To date, nearly half of the work supporting the efficacy of gratitude interventions did so by making contrasts with techniques that induce negative affect (e.g., record your daily hassles). Gratitude interventions have shown limited benefits, if any, over control conditions. Thus, there is a need to better understand whether gratitude interventions are beyond a control condition and if there exists a subset of people who benefit. People high in positive affect (PA) may have reached an 'emotional ceiling' and, thus, are less susceptible to experiencing gains in well-being. People lower in PA, however, may need more positive events (like expressing gratitude to a benefactor) to 'catch up' to the positive experiences of their peers. We examined if PA moderated the effects of a gratitude intervention where youth were instructed to write a letter to someone whom they were grateful and deliver it to them in person. Eighty-nine children and adolescents were randomly assigned to the gratitude intervention or a control condition. Findings indicated that youth low in PA in the gratitude condition, compared with youth writing about daily events, reported greater gratitude and PA at post-treatment and greater PA at the 2-month follow-up.

AB  - Objectives: We used 37 years of follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial to explore the linkage between an early educational intervention and adult health. Methods: We analyzed data from the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program (PPP), an early school-based intervention in which 123 children were randomized to a prekindergarten education group or a control group. In addition to exploring the effects of the program on health behavioral risk factors and health outcomes, we examined the extent to which educational attainment, income, family environment, and health insurance access mediated the relationship between randomization to PPP and behavioral and health outcomes. Results: The PPP led to improvements in educational attainment, health insurance, income, and family environment Improvements in these domains, in turn, lead to improvements in an array of behavioral risk factors and health (P = .01). However, despite these reductions in behavioral risk factors, participants did not exhibit any overall improvement in physical health outcomes by the age of 40 years. Conclusions: Early education reduces health behavioral risk factors by enhancing educational attainment, health insurance coverage, income, and family environments. Further follow-up will be needed to determine the long-term health effects of PPP. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study evaluated the effectiveness of an instructional intervention (schema-based instruction, SBI) that was designed to meet the diverse needs of middle school students by addressing the research literatures from both special education and mathematics education. Specifically, SBI emphasizes the role of the mathematical structure of problems and also provides students with a heuristic to aid and self-monitor problem solving. Further, SBI addresses well-articulated problem solving strategies and supports flexible use of the strategies based on the problem situation. One hundred forty eight seventh-grade students and their teachers participated in a 10-day intervention on learning to solve ratio and proportion word problems, with classrooms randomly assigned to SBI or a control condition. Results suggested that students in SBI treatment classes outperformed students in control classes on a problem solving measure, both at posttest and on a delayed posttest administered 4 months later. However, the two groups’ performance was comparable on a state standardized mathematics achievement test. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes the 2-yr post-treatment follow-up of preschoolers identified as having high levels of disruptive behavior (DB) at kindergarten entry. They were assigned to 4 treatment conditions: A no-treatment group, parent-training only, treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the treatment classroom. Interventions lasted the entire kindergarten academic year. Initial post-treatment results reported previously indicated no effects for the parent-training program but some efficacy for the classroom intervention program. For this report, the DB children were subdivided into those who did (n = 74) and did not (n = 77) receive the treatment classroom. Two-yr post-treatment follow-up results showed no differences between the classroom treated and untreated DB groups. These groups also failed to differ in the percentage of Ss using available treatments across the follow-up period. The DB Ss in both groups had significantly more symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder than a control group. They also received higher ratings of externalizing problems on the parent Child Behavior Checklist, more severe ratings of behavior problems at home, ratings of more pervasive behavior problems at school, and had poorer academic skills.

AB  - Purpose: This study tested the effects of a theory-based, middle-school human immunodeficiency virus, STI, and pregnancy prevention program, It's Your Game: Keep it Real (IYG), in delaying sexual behavior. We hypothesized that the IYG intervention would decrease the number of adolescents who initiated sexual activity by the ninth grade compared with those in the comparison schools. Methods: The target population consisted of English-speaking middle school students from a large, urban, predominantly African-American and Hispanic school district in Southeast Texas. Ten middle schools were randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to the comparison condition. Seventh-grade students were recruited and followed through ninth grade. The IYG intervention comprises 12 seventh-grade and 12 eighth-grade lessons that integrate group-based classroom activities with computer-based instruction and personal journaling. Ninth-grade follow-up surveys were completed by 907 students (92% of the defined cohort). The primary hypothesis tested was that the intervention would decrease the number of adolescents who initiated sexual activity by the ninth grade compared with those in the comparison schools. Results: Almost one-third (29.9%, n=509) of the students in the comparison condition initiated sex by ninth grade compared with almost one-quarter (23.4%, n=308) of those in the intervention condition. After adjusting for covariates, students in the comparison condition were 1.29 times more likely to initiate sex by the ninth grade than those in the intervention condition. Conclusions: A theory-driven, multi-component, curriculum-based intervention can delay sexual initiation up to 24 months; can have impact on specific types of sexual behavior such as initiation of oral and anal sex; and may be especially effective with females. Future research must explore the generalizabilty of these results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), violent and criminal behavior, and drug abuse disorders share the common antecedent of early aggressive, disruptive behavior. In the 1985-1986 school year teachers implemented the Good Behavior Game (GBG), a classroom behavior management strategy targeting aggressive, disruptive behavior and socializing children to the student role. From first through seventh grade the developmental trajectories of 2311 students from 19 Baltimore City Public Schools were examined. We report the GBG impact on these trajectories and ASPD and violent and criminal behavior by age 19-21. Methods: In five urban, poor to lower middle class predominately African-American areas, three to four schools were matched and within each set randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) GBG, (2) a reading achievement program, or (3) the standard program. Classrooms and teachers were randomly assigned to intervention or control. Measures at 19-21 included self reports and juvenile court and adult incarceration records. GBG impact was assessed via General Growth Mixture Modeling based on repeated measures of aggressive, disruptive behavior. Results: Three trajectories of aggressive, disruptive behavior were identified. By young adulthood, GBG significantly reduced the rates of ASPD and violent and criminal behavior among males in the persistent high aggressive, disruptive trajectory. Replication: A replication was implemented with the following cohort of first-grade children using the same teachers, but with diminished mentoring and monitoring. Beneficial impact was found among persistent high males through seventh grade. By young adulthood GBG effects on ASPD and violent and criminal behavior were non-significant, but generally in the hypothesized direction.

AB  - Objective: Because limited long-term outcome data exist for infants born at 32 to 36 weeks gestation, we compared school outcomes between 32- to 33-week moderate preterm (MP), 34-36 week late preterm (LP) and full-term (FT) infants. Study design: A total of 970 preterm infants and 13 671 FT control subjects were identified from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort. Test scores, teacher evaluations, and special education enrollment from kindergarten (K) to grade 5 were compared. Results: LP infants had lower reading scores than FT infants in K to first grade (P < .05). Adjusted risk for poor reading and math scores remained elevated in first grade (P < .05). Teacher evaluations of math skills from K to first grade and reading skills from K to fifth grade were worse for LP infants (P < .05). Adjusted odds for below average skills remained higher for math in K and for reading at all grades (P < .05). Special education participation was higher for LP infants at early grades (odds ratio, 1.4-2.1). MP infants had lower test and teacher evaluation scores than FT infants and twice the risk for special education at all grade levels. Conclusions: Persistent teacher concerns through grade 5 and greater special education needs among MP and LP infants suggest a need to start follow-up, anticipatory guidance, and interventions for infants born at 32 to 36 weeks gestation.

AB  - Although findings on the positive effects of early childhood development programs have been widely disseminated, less attention has been given to program impacts across the entire period of early childhood. This review summarizes evidence on the effects and cost-effectiveness of programs and services from ages 3 to 9. The major focus is preschool programs for 3- and 4-year-olds, full-day kindergarten, school-age programs including reduced class sizes, and preschool-to-third-grade interventions. Participation in preschool programs was found to have relatively large and enduring effects on school achievement and child well-being. High-quality programs for children at risk produce strong economic returns ranging from about $4 per dollar invested to over $10 per dollar invested. Relative to half-day kindergarten, the positive effects of full-day kindergarten have been found to be relatively small and generally do not last for more than a year. Although no formal economic analyses have been conducted, the economic return per dollar invested would be expected to be close to zero. Among early-school-age programs, preschool plus school-age interventions (PK-3) for children at risk are linked to higher levels of school performance into adolescence. The Child-Parent Center PK-3 Program shows a return of $6 to $9 per dollar invested. Class-size reductions show evidence of positive effects, with economic returns of roughly $3 per dollar invested. The causal mechanisms of long-term effects are discussed. Key principles to promote intervention effectiveness are offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The results of 10 experimental studies on short- and mid-term effects of various concentration training measures in preschool and primary school students are presented. In total, 292 Kindergarten students as well as 82 1st and 2nd graders with diagnosed concentration deficits (percentile < 10) were randomized either to an experimental group or a waiting-list control group. Pre-tests and post-tests with the Kaseler-Konzentrations-Aufgabe (KKA; Kasel-Concentration-Task for Children Aged 3 -8 Years) were administered individually. Post-tests were repeated once in two studies and twice in another two studies. Interventions refer to (1) daily picture-book-"reading" with parents during three weeks, (2) daily picture-book-"reading" with Kindergarten teacher during two weeks, (3) daily Jack-Straws-playing with Kindergarten teacher trainee during two weeks, (4) daily Memory-playing with Kindergarten teacher trainee during two weeks, (5) daily Jack-Straws-playing with two children during two weeks, (6) daily Memory-playing with two children during two weeks, (7) a single relaxation exercise, (8) instruction of the basic exercises of autogenic training (AT) during six weeks, (9) instruction of progressive relaxation during six weeks, and (10) daily administration of the "Marburg Concentration Training" (MKT) during six weeks. Interventions (5) and (9) were early cut short because of missing compliance of the children. Interventions (6) and (7) showed no significant effects on concentration performance. However, all the other six interventions showed statistically significant positive short-term, in part (AT, MKT) mid- and long-term effects on concentration performance in the experimental groups. Large effect sizes of these interventions point at the significance of the results in preschool and primary school education and training. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many schools have adopted early-grade retention as an intervention strategy for children displaying academic or behavioral problems. Previous analyses of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort data have found evidence of negative effects of kindergarten retention on academic learning during the repeated year. Will kindergarten retainees recover their lost ground and excel in the long run? What are the effects of first grade retention? According to the analytic results of this study, the negative effects of kindergarten retention on retainees' reading and math outcomes at the end of the treatment year substantially fade by fifth grade. Meanwhile, first grade retention shows negative effects that stay almost constant from 1 year after treatment to 3 years later. In general, we find no evidence that early-grade retention brings benefits to the retainees' reading and math learning toward the end of the elementary years.

AB  - Children who enter foster care have usually experienced maltreatment as well as disruptions in relationships with primary caregivers. These children are at risk for a host of problematic outcomes. However, there are few evidence-based interventions that target foster children. This article presents preliminary data testing the effectiveness of an intervention, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up, to target relationship formation in young children in the foster care system. Children were randomly assigned to the experimental intervention that was designed to enhance regulatory capabilities or to a control intervention. In both conditions, the foster parents received in-home training for 10 weekly sessions. Post-intervention measures were collected 1 month following the completion of the training. Outcome measures included children's diurnal production of cortisol (a stress hormone), and parent report of children's problem behaviors. Children in the experimental intervention group had lower cortisol values than children in the control intervention. Also, the experimental intervention parents reported fewer behavior problems for older versus younger foster children. Results provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of an intervention that targets children's regulatory capabilities and serve as an example of how interventions can effectively target foster children in the child welfare system.

AB  - Background: To explore whether social or emotional outcomes for high-risk early adolescent youth that attended an established preventive intervention called the Chicago Child-Parent Center Preschool Program (CPC) are moderated by individual, family and program variations. Purpose: Two questions are addressed: (1) Do the effects of CPC preschool participation on early adolescent social and emotional competency vary by sex of child, family risk status, parent education and family structure? (2) Do estimated effects on early adolescent social and emotional competency vary by program length in the preschool and school-age components of the program? Programme description: Located in or close to elementary schools in the Chicago public school system, the CPC program provides educational and family-support services to children between the ages of 3 and 9 (preschool to 2nd or 3rd grade). Within a structure of comprehensive services similar to Head Start, the intervention emphasises the acquisition of basic skills in language arts and math through relatively structured but diverse learning experiences that include teacher-directed, whole-class instruction, small-group and individualised activities, and frequent field trips. Sample: Data for this investigation were drawn from the Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS). The CLS follows a cohort of 1539 disadvantaged, minority children (93% African-American, 7% Latino or Other) who were born in 1980 and attended kindergarten programs within the Chicago Public School System in 1985/86. Out of the full sample of 1539, a subset of 989 children (64% of the sample) received preschool services from one of Chicago's 20 Child-Parent Center (CPC) programs. An additional set of 550 children (36% of the sample) did not attend CPC preschool and serve as a non-CPC comparison group. The study sample are 1378 primarily African-American youth who participated in the CLS and had scores for two or more identifiable social and emotional competency indicators by age 15. Design and methods: Follow-up of a non-randomised alternative intervention matched-group cohort at age 15 years. Differential effects were estimated using multiple regression. Program interaction terms (e.g., program × sex or program × parent high school graduate) were added to the basic regression model specification that already included the main effects of each variable included in the interaction. Results: Some 12% (or 11 of 92) of the interaction terms for social and emotional outcomes by age 15 were significant at the 0.01 or 0.05 level. The most frequently detected differential effects were for family risk level (high or low) and sex of child. Conclusions: Most children appear to benefit equally from participation in the CPC program. The prediction from ecological theory that children experiencing a large number of environmental risk factors (e.g., high family risk status and low parental education levels) are more likely to benefit from program participation was supported.

AB  - Introduction: There is debate about the type and intensity of early childhood intervention that is most helpful for children with developmental problems. The aim of the study was to determine whether a home-based programme provided over 12 months resulted in sustained improvement in development and behaviour 12 months after the intervention ceased. The characteristics of the children and families who benefited most from the intervention were also studied. Method: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: A total of 59 children, aged 3-5 years, attending two early childhood intervention centres in Melbourne, Australia. Intervention: Half of the subjects received an additional home-based programme consisting of 40 weekly visits. Main outcome measure: Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Revised, Preschool Behaviour Checklist, Bayley Behaviour Rating Scale and Behaviour Screening Questionnaire. All tests administered pre-intervention, following the intervention and 12 months later. Secondary outcome measures Family stress, support and empowerment. Results: Fifty-four children completed the assessments 12 months after conclusion of the intervention. Compared with the control group, improvement in aspects of cognitive development in the children who received the extra intervention was sustained 1 year later (P = 0.007) while significant behavioural differences post intervention were not. Analyses of the data by the Reliable Change Index indicated improvement of clinical significance occurred in non-verbal areas. In contrast to the control group who deteriorated, language skills in the intervention group remained stable. Improvements were significantly associated with higher stress in the families. Conclusion: Improvements following the provision of a home-based programme to preschool children with developmental disabilities were sustained 1 year later. Children from highly stressed families appeared to benefit most, reinforcing the importance of involving families in early childhood intervention programmes.

AB  - The Healthy Youth Places (HYP) intervention targeted increased fruit and vegetable consumption (FV) and physical activity (PA) through building the environmental change skills and efficacy of adults and youth. HYP included group training for adult school site leaders, environmental change skill curriculum, and youth-led FV and PA environment change teams. Sixteen schools were randomized to either implement the HYP program or not. Participants (N = 1,582) were assessed on FV and PA and hypothesized HYP program mediators (e.g., proxy efficacy) at the end of sixth grade (baseline), seventh grade (Postintervention Year 1), and eighth grade (Postintervention Year 2). After intervention, HYP schools did not change in FV but did significantly change in PA compared to control schools. Proxy efficacy to influence school PA environments mediated the program effects. Building the skills and efficacy of adults and youth to lead school environmental change may be an effective method to promote youth PA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the relation between emotion competence and academic competence and three potential mediators of this relation. In kindergarten, 193 children from elementary schools serving urban, minority, and low income students participated in an emotion competence assessment, and 142 of these children completed a follow-up assessment in first grade. The relation between teacher ratings of emotion regulation and academic competence was primarily indirect through the effect of emotion regulation on teacher ratings of attention. Peer acceptance and teacher closeness did not mediate the relations between emotion competence and academic competence. Results highlight the potential benefits of early emotion-centered prevention programs and the need to identify children with attention problems as early as possible to prevent academic difficulties.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the use of gluten- and casein-free diets for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We report results from a two-stage, 24-month, randomised, controlled trial incorporating an adaptive 'catch-up' design and interim analysis. Stage 1 of the trial saw 72 Danish children (aged 4 years to 10 years 11 months) assigned to diet (A) or non-diet (B) groups by stratified randomisation. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) were used to assess core autism behaviours, Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) to ascertain developmental level, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - IV scale (ADHD-IV) to determine inattention and hyperactivity. Participants were tested at baseline, 8, and 12 months. Based on per protocol repeated measures analysis, data for 26 diet children and 29 controls were available at 12 months. At this point, there was a significant improvement to mean diet group scores (time*treatment interaction) on sub-domains of ADOS, GARS and ADHD-IV measures. Surpassing of predefined statistical thresholds as evidence of improvement in group A at 12 months sanctioned the re-assignment of group B participants to active dietary treatment. Stage 2 data for 18 group A and 17 group B participants were available at 24 months. Multiple scenario analysis based on inter- and intra-group comparisons showed some evidence of sustained clinical group improvements although possibly indicative of a plateau effect for intervention. Our results suggest that dietary intervention may positively affect developmental outcome for some children diagnosed with ASD. In the absence of a placebo condition to the current investigation, we are, however, unable to disqualify potential effects derived from intervention outside of dietary changes. Further studies are required to ascertain potential best- and non-responders to intervention. The study was registered with ClincialTrials.gov, number NCT00614198.

AB  - This study assessed the immediate and short-term outcomes of adapting a culturally-grounded middle school program, keepin’ it REAL, for elementary school students. After curriculum adaptation, 10 schools were randomly assigned to the intervention in 5th grade with follow-up boosters in 6th grade; 13 schools were randomly assigned to the control condition, implementing the school’s pre-existing substance use prevention programming. Students (n = 1,566) completed a questionnaire prior to curriculum implementation and follow-up questionnaires toward the end of 5th and 6th grade. The 5th grade kiR curriculum generally appeared no more effective than the control schools’ programming in changing students’ resistance or decision-making skills; substance use intentions, expectancies, or normative beliefs; or lifetime and recent substance use. Such findings have implications for the age appropriateness of school-based programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of rich and basic instruction to incidental exposure of target words with first-grade students within the context of repeated shared storybook reading. Participants were 224 first-grade students, randomly assigned to a condition by classroom, from three elementary schools that serve large numbers of students at-risk for experiencing reading difficulties. All three conditions received large group instruction of the storybook intervention in three 20-30 minute sessions over the course of one week. Results indicated that rich instruction was superior to both basic and incidental exposure across all taught measures. These results were maintained at delayed post-test three weeks following the conclusion of the intervention. Implications are discussed in relation to a three-step approach to vocabulary instruction.

AB  - Background: In the Lidcombe Program of Early Stuttering Intervention, parents present verbal contingencies for stutter-free and stuttered speech in everyday situations. A previous randomized controlled trial of the programme with preschool-age children from 2005, conducted in two public speech clinics in New Zealand, showed that the odds of attaining clinically minimal levels of stuttering 9 months after randomization were more than seven times greater for the treatment group than for the control group. Aims: To follow up the children in the trial to determine extended long-term outcomes of the programme. Methods & Procedures: An experienced speech–language therapist who was not involved in the original trial talked with the children on the telephone, audio recording the conversations using a telephone recording jack. Parental reports were gathered in addition to the children’s speech samples in order to obtain a balance of objective data and reports from a wide range of situations. Outcomes & Results: At the time of this follow-up, the children were aged 7–12 years, with a mean of 5 years post-randomization in the 2005 trial. Twenty of the 29 children in the treatment arm and eight of the 25 children in the control (no treatment) arm were able to be contacted. Of the children in the treatment group, one (5%) failed to complete treatment and 19 had completed treatment successfully and had zero or near-zero frequency of stuttering. Three of the children (16%) who had completed treatment successfully had relapsed after 2 or more years of speech that was below 1% syllables stuttered. Meaningful comparison with the control group was not possible because an insufficient number of control children were located and some of them received treatment after completing the trial. Conclusions & Implications: The majority of preschool children are able to complete the Lidcombe Program successfully and remain below 1% syllables stuttered for a number of years. However, a minority of children do relapse and will require their parents to reinstate the treatment procedures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives : (1) To conduct a contemporary analysis of historical data on short-term efficacy of a 3-year hearing conservation program conducted from 1992 to 1996 in Wisconsin, USA, with 753 high school students actively involved in farm work; (2) to establish procedures for assessment of hearing loss for use in a recently funded follow-up of this same hearing conservation program cohort. Methods : We analyzed a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial, with schools as the unit of randomization. Thirty-four rural schools were recruited and randomized to intervention or control. The intervention included classroom instruction, distribution of hearing protection devices, direct mailings, noise level assessments, and yearly audiometric testing. The control group received the audiometric testing. Results : Students exposed to the hearing conservation program reported more frequent use of hearing protection devices, but there was no evidence of reduced levels of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Conclusion : Our analysis suggests that, since NIHL is cumulative, a 3-year study was likely not long enough to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention. While improvements in reported use of hearing protection devices were noted, the lasting impact of these behaviors is unknown and the finding merits corroboration by longer term objective hearing tests. A follow-up study of the cohort has recently been started. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of a brief group cognitive–behavioral (CB) depression prevention program for high-risk adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Method: In this indicated prevention trial, 341 at-risk youths were randomized to a group CB intervention, group supportive expressive intervention, CB bibliotherapy, or educational brochure control condition. Results: Significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms were shown by group CB participants relative to brochure control participants by 1-year follow-up and bibliotherapy participants by 1- and 2-year follow-up but not relative to supportive expressive participants. Supportive expressive participants showed greater symptom reduction than CB bibliotherapy participants did at 2-year follow-up. Risk for onset of major or minor depression over the 2-year follow-up was significantly lower for group CB participants (14%; odds ratio = 2.2) and CB bibliotherapy participants (3%; odds ratio = 8.1) than for brochure controls (23%). Conclusions: Results indicate that this group CB intervention reduces initial symptoms and risk for future depressive episodes, although both supportive expressive therapy and CB bibliotherapy also produce intervention effects that persist long term. Indeed, CB bibliotherapy emerged as the least expensive method of reducing risk for future episodes of depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - School-based drug prevention curricula constitute the nation’s most prevalent strategy to prevent adolescent drug use. We evaluated the effects of one such curriculum, Project ALERT, on adolescent substance use. In particular, we sought to determine if a single effect on 30-day alcohol use, noted shortly following the completion of the 2-year program, could be detected 1 year later. We also looked for delayed effects on other outcomes of interest, namely lifetime alcohol use, and 30-day and lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, and inhalants. We employed a randomized controlled trial that used school as the unit of assignment. Thirty-four schools with grades 6–8 from 11 states completed the study. Seventy-one Project ALERT instructors taught 11 core lessons to sixth graders and 3 booster lessons to seventh graders. Students were assessed prior to the onset of the intervention, as sixth graders, after the completion of the 2-year curriculum, as seventh graders, and again 1 year later as eighth graders. This paper examines data from the pretest and final posttest. Using hierarchical nonlinear modeling, we found that our earlier effect on 30-day alcohol use did not persist. Further, we continued to find no effects for lifetime alcohol use and both the lifetime and 30-day use of cigarettes, marijuana, and inhalants. Our findings do not support the long-term effectiveness of Project ALERT, when delivered to sixth graders. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the longitudinal effects of 2 first-grade universal preventive interventions on academic outcomes (e.g., achievement, special education service use, graduation, postsecondary education) through age 19 in a sample of 678 urban, primarily African American children. The classroom-centered intervention combined the Good Behavior Game (H. H. Barrish, Saunders, & Wolfe, 1969) with an enhanced academic curriculum, whereas a second intervention, the Family–School Partnership, focused on promoting parental involvement in educational activities and bolstering parents’ behavior management strategies. Both programs aimed to address the proximal targets of aggressive behavior and poor academic achievement. Although the effects varied by gender, the classroom-centered intervention was associated with higher scores on standardized achievement tests, greater odds of high school graduation and college attendance, and reduced odds of special education service use. The intervention effects of the Family–School Partnership were in the expected direction; however, only 1 effect reached statistical significance. The findings of this randomized controlled trial illustrate the long-term educational impact of preventive interventions in early elementary school.

AB  - Background: This study examined the long-term efficacy of the Incredible Years (IY) BASIC Parenting Programme delivered as a preventive intervention with parents of pre-school children who display signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct problems. Families were followed up after the completion of a controlled trial with 11 Sure Start areas in North and Mid-Wales and North West England. Methods: Participants in the study were 50 pre-school children whose parents had received the intervention. Child ADHD symptoms were assessed at baseline, at follow-up one (6 months after baseline); at follow-up two (12 months after baseline); and at follow-up three (18 months after baseline). Families in the original waiting-list control group were not assessed after follow-up one as they had subsequently received the same intervention. Results: The significant post-intervention improvements in child ADHD symptoms evident at follow-up one were maintained over time, as demonstrated by statistical and clinical stability of measures. No significant differences were found for ADHD symptoms across each follow-up, indicating that the gains made post intervention were maintained for at least 12 months, with 57% of the sample maintaining scores below the clinical cut-off on the Conners. Eighty-six, 58, and 30 per cent respectively had maintained at least a modest, large, or very large improvement in ADHD symptoms at follow-up three. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that the IY psychosocial treatment programme is a valuable intervention in the longer term for many pre-school children displaying early signs of ADHD.

AB  - Background: While school-based anti-bullying programs are widely used, there have been few controlled trials of effectiveness. This study compared the effect of manualized School Psychiatric Consultation (SPC), CAPSLE (a systems and mentalization focused whole school intervention), and treatment-as-usual (TAU) in reducing aggression and victimization among elementary school children. Method: Participants were 1,345 third to fifth graders in nine elementary schools in a medium-sized Midwestern city who took part in a cluster-level randomized controlled trial with stratified restricted allocation, to assess efficacy after two years of active intervention and effectiveness after one year of minimal input maintenance intervention. Outcome measures included peer and self-reports of bullying, by standing, and mentalizing behavior and classroom behavioral observations of disruptive and off-task behavior. Results: CAPSLE moderated the developmental trend of increasing peer-reported victimization (p < .01), aggression (p < .05), self-reported aggression (p < .05) and aggressive by standing (p < .05), compared to TAU schools. CAPSLE also moderated a decline in empathy and an increase in the percent of children victimized compared to SPC (p < .01) and TAU conditions (p < .01). Results for self-reported victimization, helpful by standing, and beliefs in the legitimacy of aggression did not suggest significantly different changes among the study conditions over time. CAPSLE produced a significant decrease in off-task (p < .001) and disruptive classroom behaviors (p < .01), while behavioral change was not observed in SPC and TAU schools. Superiority with respect to TAU for victimization (p < .05), aggression (p < .01), and helpful (p < .05) and aggressive by standing (p < .01) were maintained in the follow-up year. Conclusions: A teacher-implemented school-wide intervention that does not focus on disturbed children substantially reduced aggression and improved classroom behavior.

AB  - Objective: The present study evaluates the long-term effects of a preschool training in phonological awareness and letter-sound correspondence. Method: The children from the experimental and the control group of the original study (Blaser et al., 2007) were retested by means of reading and writing tests at the end of the 3rd and 4th grades. Results: Results reveal no significant difference between the trained group and the control group with regard to their average reading and writing performance. Effects of the training are seen in the reduction of the number of children with spelling problems in the trained group. The training had no detectable positive effects on the percentage of children with reading problems. Conclusions: In summary, results are interpreted as a confirmation of the effectiveness of the training in the primary prevention of spelling problems. In spite of these results a small percentage of children remains that develops reading and spelling problems despite having participated in the preventive intervention. Future research should focus upon these children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study reports a randomized controlled trial evaluation of a computer-based balanced literacy intervention, ABRACADABRA (http://grover.concordia.ca/abra/version1/abracadabra.html). Children (N = 144) in Grade 1 were exposed either to computer activities for word analysis, text comprehension, and fluency, alongside shared stories (experimental groups), or to balanced literacy approaches delivered by their classroom teachers (control group). Two computer-based interventions—a phoneme-based synthetic phonics method and a rime-based analytic phonics method—were contrasted. Children were taught 4 times per week for 12 weeks in small groups. There were significant improvements in letter knowledge in the analytic phonics program and significant improvements in phonological awareness, listening comprehension, and reading comprehension at immediate posttest and in phonological awareness and reading fluency at a delayed posttest in the synthetic phonics program. Effect size analyses confirmed that both interventions had a significant impact on literacy at both posttests. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this study, response to intervention and stability of reading performance of 41 kindergarten children identified as at risk of reading difficulty were evaluated from kindergarten through third grade. All students were assessed in the fall of each academic year to evaluate need for intervention, and students who fell below the 30th percentile on criterion measures received small-group supplemental intervention. Measures included a combination of commercial normative referenced measures and specific skill and construct measures to assess growth or change in reading risk status relative to 30th percentile benchmarks. Results indicated that consistent with the findings of prior research involving students with comparable entry-level performance, the majority of children identified as at risk in the beginning of kindergarten responded early and positively to intervention. On average, absolute performance levels at the end of kindergarten positioned students for trajectories of later reading performance that exceeded the 50th percentile on the majority of measures. Moreover, changes in risk status that occurred early were generally sustained over time. Only oral reading fluency performance failed to exceed the 30th percentile for the majority of students.

AB  - The present study aimed to assess the impact of a primary prevention program on eating-related attitudes in 231 female 7th graders at baseline and following a six-session prevention program. Fifty-nine 7th grade control females received six unstructured lectures about adolescence. One hundred and three experimental students and 37 controls were re-evaluated after one year. Among the participants in the prevention program, there was a significant post-intervention and one-year improvement in the total score of the eating-related attitudinal Treatment Efficacy Scale (TES) and in several of its domains. Whereas no change occurred in the attitudes of the controls at post-intervention, some improvement was shown in several TES domains after one year, compared to baseline. Attitudinal changes were significantly more favorable in the prevention program participants than in the controls both at post-intervention and at one-year follow-up. These findings suggest that eating-related attitudes of female middle-school students may improve following a primary prevention program, with some of these improvements persisting after one year.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the long-term impact of a childhood motor skill intervention on adolescent motor skills and physical activity. Methods: In 2006, we undertook a follow-up of motor skill proficiency (catch, kick, throw, vertical jump, side gallop) and physical activity in adolescents who had participated in a one-year primary school intervention Move It Groove It (MIGI) in 2000. Logistic regression models were analysed for each skill to determine whether the probability of children in the intervention group achieving mastery or near mastery was either maintained or had increased in subsequent years, relative to controls. In these models the main predictor variable was intervention status, with adjustment for gender, grade, and skill level in 2000. A general linear model, controlling for gender and grade, examined whether former intervention students spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at follow-up than control students. Results: Half (52%, n = 481) of the 928 MIGI participants were located in 28 schools, with 276 (57%) assessed. 52% were female, 58% in Grade 10, 40% in Grade 11 and 54% were former intervention students. At follow-up, intervention students had improved their catch ability relative to controls and were five times more likely to be able to catch: ORcatch = 5.51, CI (1.95 – 15.55), but had lost their advantage in the throw and kick: ORthrow = .43, CI (.23 – .82), ORkick = .39, CI (.20 – .78). For the other skills, intervention students appeared to maintain their advantage: ORjump = 1.14, CI (.56 – 2.34), ORgallop = 1.24, CI (.55 – 2.79). Intervention students were no more active at follow-up. Conclusion: Six years after the 12-month MIGI intervention, whilst intervention students had increased their advantage relative to controls in one skill, and appeared to maintain their advantage in two, they lost their advantage in two skills and were no more active than controls at follow up. More longitudinal research is needed to explore whether gains in motor skill proficiency in children can be sustained and to determine the intervention characteristics that translate to subsequent physical activity.

AB  - This article describes the development and immediate effects of a small-group intervention designed to complement a school-based prevention program for children and youth. The REAL Groups intervention is the result of a partnership with predominately Mexican American schools located in the central city neighborhoods of a southwestern U.S. metropolitan area. The group members (N = 115) were fifth graders from six central city schools. Group members were identified and referred by their teachers as in need of additional support beyond the keepin’it REAL classroom- based substance abuse prevention intervention, or they were invited by the referred students. The REAL Groups followed a mutual aid approach, and Masters in Social Work student interns trained in the REAL Groups intervention served as the group facilitators. This article describes the small-group intervention and provides an initial report on the results by comparing the small-group members (n = 115) with Mexican-heritage classmates (n = 306) who only received the classroom-based keepin’ it REAL prevention intervention. This is a feasibility study in preparation for the follow-up study with seventh graders. As expected due to the low drug-use rates reported by fifth-grade participants, the effectiveness results were inconclusive. The immediate findings, however, provide important information about the design and evaluation of culturally specific group interventions with acculturating children. The article provides important methodological and practice implications for small-group school-based interventions as well as recommendations for future research.

AB  - Early onset of substance use among adolescents has been found to be associated with later risky sexual behaviors. This study examined long-term follow-up data from a large randomized school-based drug prevention trial to (1) investigate the long-term impact of the prevention program on drug use and sexual behaviors that put one at elevated risk for HIV infection; and (2) use growth modeling procedures to examine potential mechanisms of intervention effects. Self-report survey data were collected from students in the 7th grade, prior to the intervention in 1985, and in grades 8,9,10, and 12. Participants in the intervention condition received a 30-session drug prevention program in 7th through 9th grades. Follow-up surveys were completed by 2042 young adults (mean age = 24) in 1998. As young adults, participants were considered to be engaging in high-risk behavior for HIV infection if they reported having multiple sex partners, having intercourse when drunk or very high, and recent high-risk substance use. The intervention had a direct protective effect on HIV risk behavior in the overall sample in young adulthood. Furthermore, among participants receiving 60% or more of the prevention program, analyses showed that the intervention significantly reduced growth in alcohol and marijuana intoxication over the course of adolescence, which in turn was associated with a reduction in later HIV risk behavior. The behavioral effects of competence-enhancement drug prevention programs can extend to risk behaviors including those that put one at risk for HIV infection.

AB  - Data are lacking on long-term effects of HIV behavioural intervention programmes. In this study, we report intervention effects 36 months postintervention on condom use and relevant outcome variables from the theory-based programme 'Focus on Youth in the Caribbean' (FOYC). Participants (1360 sixth-grade youth) were randomized by school into: (1) FOYC, plus one of two brief parent interventions or (2) the control condition 'Wondrous Wetlands', plus a brief parent intervention. Mixed effect analysis demonstrated significant programme effects, including enhanced HIV/AIDS knowledge (effect size D = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.46), increased self-efficacy of (D = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.54), skills for (D = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.64) and intention to use a condom (D = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.37). Youth who received FOYC plus the parental monitoring intervention had higher condom use rates (odds ratio = 1.49,95% CI: 0.97, 2.28). Feedback effects from key variables were also detected, supporting the sustained effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based substance abuse prevention program developed in the EU-Dap study (EUropean Drug Addiction Prevention trial). Materials and methods: Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial. Seven European countries participated in the study; 170 schools (7079 pupils 12–14 years of age) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions or to a control condition during the school year 2004/2005. The program consisted of a 12-h curriculum based on a comprehensive social influence approach. A pre-test survey assessing past and current substance use was conducted before the implementation of the program, while a post-test survey was carried out about 18 months after the pre-test. The association between program condition and change in substance use at post-test was expressed as adjusted prevalence odds ratio (POR), estimated by multilevel regression models. Results: Persisting beneficial program effects were found for episodes of drunkenness (any, POR = 0.80; 0.67–0.97; frequent, POR = 0.62; 0.47–0.81) and for frequent cannabis use in the past 30 days (POR = 0.74; 0.53–1.00), whereas daily cigarette smoking was not affected by the program as it was at the short-term follow-up. Baseline non-smokers that participated in the program progressed in tobacco consumption to a lower extent than those in the control condition, but no difference was detected in the proportion of quitters or reducers among baseline daily smokers. Conclusion: The experimental evaluation of an innovative school curriculum based on a comprehensive social influence approach, indicated persistent positive effects over 18 months for alcohol abuse and for cannabis use, but not for cigarette smoking.

AB  - Objective: Given the increasing prevalence of pediatric obesity, we evaluated two kindergarten-based strategies for reducing overweight in preschool children in the Haute-Garonne Department in France. Methods: Kindergartens (n=79) were randomly assigned to one of the two strategies and followed for 2 years. In the first group (Epidémiologie et prévention de l’obésité infantile, EPIPOI-1), parents and teachers received basic information on overweight and health, and children underwent screening to identify those with overweight (body mass index (BMI) 90th percentile) or at risk for overweight (BMI between 75 and ≥90th percentile), who were then followed up by their physicians. EPIPOI-2 children, in addition, received kindergarten-based education to promote healthy practices related to nutrition, physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Data on control children from non-intervention kindergartens (n=40) were retrieved from medical records at the Division of School Health. Results: At baseline, groups differed significantly on age and school area (underprivileged/ not). Owing to a significant interaction between school area and group, analyses were stratified by school area. At baseline, groups did not differ on overweight prevalence and BMI z-scores for any school area. After intervention, prevalence of overweight, BMI z-score and change in BMI z-score were significantly lower in intervention groups compared with controls in underprivileged areas. Using multilevel analysis adjusted for potential confounders, a significant effect on overweight prevalence at the end of the study was noted for EPIPOI-1 in underprivileged areas only (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 0.18 (0.07–0.51). In non-underprivileged areas, the gain in BMI z-score was lower in EPIPOI-2 group compared with control and EPIPOI-1. Conclusion: Our results suggest that simple measures involving increasing awareness on overweight and health, and periodic monitoring of weight and height with follow-up care when indicated, could be useful to reduce overweight in young children from underprivileged areas. A reinforced strategy with an education component, in addition, may be indicated in children in non-underprivileged areas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Great Start Readiness Program (GSRP) has existed as a state-funded preschool initiative for more than 20 years. Since 1995, GSRP has been evaluated by the HighScope Educational Research Foundation. This chapter starts by describing the program and its history. It then provides an overview of GSRP child outcome findings from six studies that were reported between 1997 and 2007. This summary focuses both on short-term and longitudinal outcomes and concludes with implications for future research. This chapter focuses on child outcomes first enumerated in six evaluation reports to the state of Michigan between 1997 and 2007. They included cohorts of GSRP children followed from preschool through the eighth grade. Four reports (Early Returns 1997, Points of Light 2000, Effects Five Years Later 2002, and the 6-8th Grade Follow Up Study 2007) analyzed data collected over time from an original cohort of 596 children (338 GSRP graduates and 258 matched non-GSRP children) from six districts across the state. The comparison-group children were selected based on two criteria: They did not have a preschool experience and they were low income. Selection of both the GSRP and comparison group took place during the children's kindergarten year. The fifth project was a collaboration between HighScope and the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER). The sixth project, the GSRP Variation Study, recently completed data collection through first grade. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a classroom-based psychoeducation and skills intervention (tier 1) and a school-based trauma- and grief-focused group treatment (tier 2) of a three-tiered mental health program for adolescents exposed to severe war-related trauma, traumatic bereavement, and postwar adversity. Method: A total of 127 war-exposed and predominantly ethnic Muslim secondary school students attending 10 schools in central Bosnia who reported severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or maladaptive grief and significant impairment in school or relationships were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions. These included either an active-treatment comparison condition (tier 1), consisting of a classroom-based psychoeducation and skills intervention alone (n = 61, 66% girls, mean age 16.0 years, SD 1.13) or a treatment condition composed of both the classroom-based intervention and a 17-session manual-based group therapy intervention (tier 2), trauma and grief component therapy for adolescents (n = 66, 63% girls, mean age 15.9 years, SD 1.11). Both interventions were implemented throughout the school year. Distressed students who were excluded from the study due to acute risk for harm (n = 9) were referred for community-based mental health services (tier 3). Results: Program effectiveness was measured via reductions in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and maladaptive grief assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 4-month follow-up. Analysis of mean-level treatment effects showed significant pre- to posttreatment and posttreatment to 4-month follow-up reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms in both the treatment and comparison conditions. Significant pre- to posttreatment reductions in maladaptive grief reactions were found only in the treatment condition. Analyzed at the individual case level, the percentages of students in the treatment condition who reported significant (p <.05) pre- to posttreatment reductions in PTSD symptoms (58% at posttreatment, 81% at 4-month follow-up) compare favorably to those reported in controlled treatment efficacy trials, whereas the percentages who reported significant reductions in depression symptoms (23% at posttreatment, 61% at follow-up) are comparable to, or higher than, those found in community treatment settings. Lower but substantial percentages of significant symptom reduction were found for PTSD (33% at posttreatment, 48% at follow-up) and depression symptoms (13% at posttreatment; 47% at follow-up) in students in the comparison condition. The odds of significant symptom reduction were higher for PTSD symptoms at both posttreatment and 4-month follow-up and for maladaptive grief at posttreatment (no follow-up was conducted on maladaptive grief). Rates of significantly worsened cases were generally rare in both the treatment and comparison conditions. Conclusions: A three-tiered, integrative mental health program composed of school-wide dissemination of psychoeducation and coping skills (tier 1), specialized trauma- and grief-focused intervention for severely traumatized and traumatically bereaved youths (tier 2), and referral of youths at acute risk for community-based mental health services (tier 3) constitutes an effective and efficient method for promoting adolescent recovery in postwar settings.

AB  - Purpose: This Phase I trial sought to establish (1) whether the Lidcombe Program is viable for school-age children, (2) whether there is any indication that it requires modification for school-age children, (3) whether treatment effects are durable, (4) how many treatment sessions appear to be required to significantly reduce stuttering frequency and (5) whether there is an association between follow-up period and relapse tendency. Method: Twelve children were treated, and one required an addition to the Lidcombe Program. The results for this child were excluded from group analysis, leaving a group of 6–10 year-olds. A retrospective method was used using routine pre-treatment clinic recordings. At follow-up, all children were telephoned and audio-recorded three times at random times during the day within a 7–10-day period. Results: A blinded observer's mean percent syllables stuttered score pre-treatment was 9.2 and 1.9 at follow-up. No association was found between follow-up period and stuttering rates. The mean syllables per minute score pre-treatment was 145.8 and 179.3 at follow-up. These results were attained in a median of eight clinic visits with a range of 6–10 visits. Conclusions: Procedurally, the Lidcombe Program is viable for school-age children and parents report enjoyment in administering it. There appears to be a treatment effect that can be attained in a reasonable number of clinical hours. These results compel continued exploration with young school-aged children in subsequent Phase II and III studies. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (1) summarize the status of clinical trials for stuttering school-age children, (2) describe the phases of clinical trial development, (3) evaluate outcomes the Lidcombe Program for a school-age population in terms of stuttering reduction and treatment time, (4) evaluate the suitability of the Lidcombe Program with population of school-age stuttering children, and (5) provide an interpretation of the finding of no correlation between follow-up and post-treatment stuttering rates.

AB  - Evaluated the sustained effectiveness of a middle school service learning intervention on reducing sexual initiation and recent sex among urban African American and Latino adolescents from 7th grade through the 10th grade. During the fall of seventh grade and again in eighth grade, students were randomly assigned by classroom to participate either in community youth service (CYS) or not (controls). Service learning is an educational strategy that couples meaningful service in the community with classroom instruction. Students in both intervention and control conditions received classroom health lessons. Surveys were conducted at seventh grade baseline and at the end of 10th grade, approximately 2 years after intervention. Self-reported sexual behaviors of youths who had participated in CYS were compared with those of controls receiving classroom curriculum alone. A service learning intervention that combines community involvement with health instruction can have a long-term benefit by reducing sexual risk taking among urban adolescents.

AB  - Examined factors related to smoking behavior, attitudes and knowledge among Israeli adolescents in a 3-yr cohort study. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 748 students in the 9th grade, by 448 of these students in the 11th grade and by 388 of the students in the 12th grade. 312 pupils completed all 3 questionnaires. Results show there were no significant sociodemographic differences between the responses by students over the course of the study. Eight 9th graders were active smokers (at least 1 cigarette daily for the last mo) compared with 64 in the 11th grade and 70 in the 12th grade. Most pupils knew the health hazards of smoking. Variables associated with smoking in the 11th grade included religiosity (religion was associated with lower smoking rates), past experimentation with smoking, smoking among family members, perceived future smoking status, self-image, influence of a teacher or celebrity, and peer pressure. These results were similar for the 12th grade students, except for active or previous smoking by gender (a significantly greater proportion of females than males). Implications for intervention programs are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article describes a follow-up study that experimentally evaluated the effects of supplemental reading instruction for children in kindergarten through Grade 3. Students from 10 elementary schools in three school districts were screened using the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills. Two hundred fifty-six K-2 students were identified for participation, then randomly assigned to receive or not receive 2 years of supplemental reading instruction that taught basic decoding and comprehension skills. Reading ability was measured in the fall prior to the first year of the intervention and again in the spring of Years 1, 2, and 3. At the end of the 2-year intervention, children who received the supplemental instruction performed better on measures of word attack, word identification, oral reading fluency, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. One year after the intervention, children in the supplemental instruction group still showed greater improvement in word attack and oral reading fluency than the comparison students.

AB  - Background: The Good Behavior Game (GBG), a method of classroom behavior management used by teachers, was tested in first- and second-grade classrooms in 19 Baltimore City Public Schools beginning in the 1985-1986 school year. The intervention was directed at the classroom as a whole to socialize children to the student role and reduce aggressive, disruptive behaviors, confirmed antecedents of later substance abuse and dependence disorders, smoking, and antisocial personality disorder. This article reports on impact to ages 19-21. Methods: In five poor to lower-middle class, mainly African American urban areas, three or four schools were matched and within each set randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) GBG, (2) a curriculum-and-instruction program directed at reading achievement, or (3) the standard program. Balanced assignment of children to classrooms was made, and then, within intervention schools, classrooms and teachers were randomly assigned to intervention or control. Results: By young adulthood significant impact was found among males, particularly those in first grade who were more aggressive, disruptive, in reduced drug and alcohol abuse/dependence disorders, regular smoking, and antisocial personality disorder. These results underline the value of a first-grade universal prevention intervention. Replication: A replication was implemented with the next cohort of first-grade children with the same teachers during the following school year, but with diminished mentoring and monitoring of teachers. The results showed significant GBG impact for males on drug abuse/dependence disorders with some variation. For other outcomes the effects were generally smaller but in the predicted direction.

AB  - This study examined long-term follow-up data from a large-scale randomized trial to determine the extent to which participation in a school-based drug abuse prevention program during junior high school led to less risky driving among high school students. Self-report data collected from students in the 7th, 10th, and 12th grades were matched by name to students' department of motor vehicles (DMV) records at the end of high school. The DMV data included the total number of violations on students' driving records as well as the number of "points" that indicate the frequency and severity of the violations. A series of logistic regression analyses revealed that males were more likely to have violations and points on their driving records than females, and regular alcohol users were more likely to have violations and points than those who did not use alcohol regularly. Controlling for gender and alcohol use, students who received the drug prevention program during junior high school were less likely to have violations and points on their driving records relative to control group participants that did not receive the prevention program. Findings indicated that antidrinking attitudes mediated the effect of the intervention on driving violations, but not points. These results support the hypothesis that the behavioral effects of competence-enhancement prevention programs can extend to risk behaviors beyond the initial focus of intervention, such as risky driving.

AB  - This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of the FRIENDS Program in reducing anxiety and depression in a sample of children from Grade 6 and Grade 9 in comparison to a control condition. Longitudinal data for Lock and Barrett's (2003) universal prevention trial is presented, along with data from 12-month follow-up to 24- and 36-month follow-up. Results of this study indicate that intervention reductions in anxiety reported in Lock and Barrett were maintained for students in Grade 6, with the intervention group reporting significantly lower ratings of anxiety at long-term follow-up. A significant Time × Intervention Group × Gender Effect on Anxiety was found, with girls in the intervention group reporting significantly lower anxiety at 12-month and 24-month follow-up but not at 36-month follow-up in comparison to the control condition. Results demonstrated a prevention effect with significantly fewer high-risk students at 36-month follow-up in the intervention condition than in the control condition. Results are discussed within the context of prevention research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examines the impact of 2 preventive interventions on the prevalence of conduct problems/disorder and mental health service need/use for 687 1st graders(5.3–7.7 yrs at time of intervention). The classroom-centered (CC) intervention was designed to reduce the risk for later conduct problems and disorder by enhancing teachers' behavior management in 1st grade, whereas the Family–School Partnership (FSP) intervention targeted improvement in parent–teacher communication and parents' child behavior management strategies. At followup (6th grade), CC and FSP children received significantly lower ratings on conduct problems than control children. CC and FSP children were also significantly less likely than control children to meet diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder and to have been suspended from school in the last year. CC intervention was also associated with significantly lower rates of child mental health service need and utilization. Overall, the CC intervention appeared to be the more effective of the two in reducing the prevalence of conduct problems and disorder at age 12 and in reducing mental health service need and utilization. Nevertheless, future studies may show that the combination of CC and FSP interventions produces additive or even synergistic effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of code-oriented supplemental instruction for kindergarten students at risk for reading difficulties. Paraeducators were trained to provide 18 weeks of explicit instruction in phonemic skills and the alphabetic code. Students identified by their teachers meeting study eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to 2 groups: individual supplemental instruction and control. Students were pretested in December, midtested, and posttested in May-June of kindergarten. At posttest, treatment students significantly outperformed controls on measures of reading accuracy, reading efficiency, oral reading fluency, and developmental spelling. Treatment students had significantly higher linear growth rates in phonemic awareness and alphabetic knowledge during the kindergarten treatment. At a 1-year follow-up, significant group differences remained in reading accuracy and efficiency. Ethical challenges of longitudinal intervention research are discussed. Findings have policy implications for making supplemental instruction in critical early reading skills available. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This longitudinal study evaluates the effectiveness of a psychomotor sport program on the grapho-motor skills of first graders. The children were studied at three points in time (before and after a training intervention as well as after a six-month latency in a follow-up) with respect to their grapho-motor performances as well as their fine motor performances. The total sample of 264 pupils (average age: 6.7 years) was divided into one experimental (EG, n = 138) and two control groups (CG 1: n = 65; CG 2: n = 61). The EG received a 10-week special psychomotor program (ÜPS!, Stachelhaus, 2005), which was conducted during the PE lessons at school (3 × 45 min. per week). CG 1, at the same time, had regular PE lessons, while CG 2 received a play program that contrasted with the ÜPS! All subjects were assessed by the Graphomotor Test Battery (Rudolf, 1986) and a tapping test for children (Punktiertest, Schilling, 1979). These tests require fine motor accuracy and precision as well as fine motor rapidness. Results show a significant increase in grapho-motor accuracy and precision for the EG immediately after the treatment as well as after 6 months of latency in comparison to the control groups. In terms of fine-motor rapidness, results show an increase of speed for the EG as well as for both of the CGs. It was concluded that these results indicate a strong effect of psychomotor education on accuracy and precision of grapho-motor skills but not on the speed.

AB  - Background: Several systematic reviews of school-based smoking prevention trials have shown short-term decreases in smoking prevalence but have not examined long-term follow-up evaluation. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of rigorously evaluated interventions for school-based smoking prevention with long-term follow-up data. Methods: We searched online bibliographic databases and reference lists from review articles and selected studies. We included all school-based, randomized, controlled trials of smoking prevention with follow-up evaluation to age 18 or 12th grade and at least 1 year after intervention ended, and that had smoking prevalence as a primary outcome. The primary outcome was current smoking prevalence (defined as at least 1 cigarette in the past month). Results: The abstracts or full-text articles of 177 relevant studies were examined, of which 8 met the selection criteria. The 8 articles included studies differing in intervention intensity, presence of booster sessions, follow-up periods, and attrition rates. Only one study showed decreased smoking prevalence in the intervention group. Conclusions: Few studies have evaluated the long-term impact of school-based smoking prevention programs rigorously. Among the 8 programs that have follow-up data to age 18 or 12th grade, we found little to no evidence of long-term effectiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 35(4) of The Journal of Primary Prevention (see record [rid]2014-26459-001[/rid]). The published version of the original article reports findings from a cluster randomized trial. There were errors in the stated individual-level sample sizes and rates reported in the Participant Characteristics paragraph. The corrections are given in the erratum.] It is becoming increasingly common for community teams or coalitions to implement programming for children and families designed to promote positive youth development and prevent adolescent problem behaviors. However, there has been only limited rigorous study of the effectiveness of community teams’ programming efforts to produce positive outcomes. This study employed a community-level randomized control design to examine protective parent and youth skills outcomes of evidence-based preventive interventions selected from a menu and delivered by community teams supported by a community–university partnership model called PROSPER. Twenty-eight rural communities in two states were randomized across intervention and control conditions. Data were collected through written questionnaires that were completed by approximately 12,000 middle school students in the fall of the 6th grade, prior to intervention delivery, and again in the spring of the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. Positive intervention effects were found for youth, parent, and family outcomes (e.g., association with antisocial peers, child management, parent–child affective quality) at each post-intervention assessment point. Improvements in these family and youth skill outcomes are expected to support long-term reductions of adolescent problem behaviors, such as substance abuse. Editors’ Strategic Implications: In this important and well controlled trial, the authors demonstrate that university partnership-supported community teams, especially when supported with ongoing technical assistance, can continue to produce positive outcomes even after much of the control over delivery of programs is turned over to representatives of the communities in which they are implemented.

AB  - The study reports a group-randomized trial of a theatre-based intervention to prevent sexual abuse targeting first and second grade primary school children in Germany. A sample of 148 first and second graders saw a live performance of a play designed to promote skills in dealing with abuse-prone interactions with adults, watched a recording of the play on DVD or were assigned to a no intervention control group. Both the live performance and the DVD groups showed significant increases in the target variables (distinguishing good/bad touch and secrets, getting help, rejecting unwanted touch) from baseline to post-intervention and a follow-up after 2 weeks, while the control group did not show changes. The live performance and DVD groups participated in a further follow-up 30 weeks post-intervention, which showed sustained effects of the intervention. The findings indicate that with appropriately culture-sensitive measures, sexual abuse prevention programmes can have sustainable effects with young primary school children.

AB  - Objectives: We evaluated the effectiveness of a parent-based add-on component to a school-based intervention to prevent cigarette smoking among African American and Latino middle school youths. Methods: Mother–adolescent dyads (n=1386) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: (1) a school-based smoking-prevention intervention or (2) the same intervention with a parent-based add-on component called Raising Smoke-Free Kids. Mothers in the experimental condition received the parent add-on component. Mothers in the control condition received information on selecting a high school. All adolescents received a version of Project Towards No Tobacco Use (TNT). The primary outcome was a reduction in adolescent cigarette smoking. Follow-up data were obtained from 1096 mother–adolescent dyads at 15 months postintervention. Results: At follow-up, the odds of smoking cigarettes were reduced by 42% for adolescents in the parent add-on condition versus the TNT-only condition. Mothers in the parent add-on condition were more likely than were mothers in the TNT-only condition to set rules about risk-sensitive social activities and to be perceived as trustworthy by their child. Group differences also were found in the frequency and quality of mother–adolescent communication. Conclusions: Including parent add-on components in school-based smoking prevention programs can reduce smoking behavior on the part of inner-city middle school youths.

AB  - This study was designed to test the efficacy of Parents Who Care© (PWC), a seven-session universal prevention program which includes parenting, youth, and family components designed to prevent substance use and other problem behaviors. Using an intent-to-treat experimental design, this study tests the program efficacy across race within a balanced sample of European American (EA) and African American (AA) youth and their parents (n = 331 nAA = 163; nEA = 168). Families were recruited, randomly assigned to three conditions (group-administered [PA], self-administered with telephone support [SA], and no-treatment control) and the intervention was administered when the adolescents were in the eighth grade. Analyses on key teen outcomes of the Parent's Who Care program at 24-month follow-up are reported here and include perceptions of drug use harm; favorable attitudes about drug use; delinquent and violent behavior; and initiation into cigarette, alcohol, other drug use, or sexual activity. Repeated measures mixed model regressions found no effect of the intervention on rate of change in attitudes about drug use or frequency of delinquent or violent behavior. Regression analyses with multiple imputations for missing data detected group differences in means at 24-month follow-up. Both program formats reduced favorable attitudes toward drug use among youth (SA d = 0.39, PA d = 0.22); and AA youth in the self-administered intervention reported significantly less violent behavior than their control counterparts (d = 0.45). No effects were found for drug use harm or delinquency. Finally, logistic regression predicting a combined outcome measure of initiation of alcohol, tobacco, drug use, and/or sexual activity found AA youth in both the group- and self-administered intervention conditions significantly less likely to initiate substance use and/or sexual activity than those in the control condition. Odds ratios indicated the chances of initiating sex or substance use were reduced by almost 70% (OR = 0.31) for AA teens in the SA condition compared to controls, and 75% (OR = 0.25) for the AA teens in the PA compared to controls.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of two preventive interventions to reduce heavy drinking in first- and second-year high school students. Design and setting: Cluster randomized controlled trial using four conditions for comparing two active interventions with a control group from 152 classes of 19 high schools in the Netherlands. Participants: A total of 3490 first-year high school students (mean 12.68 years, SD 0.51) and their parents. Intervention conditions: (i) Parent intervention (modeled on the Swedish Örebro Prevention Program) aimed at encouraging parental rule-setting concerning their children's alcohol consumption; (ii) student intervention consisting of four digital lessons based on the principles of the theory of planned behavior and social cognitive theory; (iii) interventions 1 and 2 combined; and (iv) the regular curriculum as control condition. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of (heavy) weekly alcohol use and frequency of monthly drinking at 10 and 22 months after baseline measurement. Findings: A total of 2937 students were eligible for analyses in this study. At first follow-up, only the combined student parent intervention showed substantial and statistically significant effects on heavy weekly drinking, weekly drinking and frequency of drinking. At second follow-up these results were replicated, except for the effects of the combined intervention on heavy weekly drinking. These findings were consistent across intention-to-treat and completers-only analyses. Conclusions: Results suggest that adolescents as well as their parents should be targeted in order to delay the onset of drinking, preferably prior to onset of weekly drinking.

AB  - Although randomized controlled trials demonstrated the long-term efficacy of lifestyle interventions in overweight children, the effects of these interventions in clinical practice under real-life conditions are largely unknown. One hundred twenty-nine centers specialized in outpatient pediatric obesity care participated in this quality assessment. All patients presenting before the year 2006 for lifestyle intervention of at least 6 months duration in these institutions were analyzed in a 2-year follow-up. A total of 21,784 (45% male) overweight children and adolescents aged 2-20 years (mean BMI 30.4kg/m², mean SDS-BMI 2.51, mean age 12.6 years) were included in the analysis. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis with variables set back to baseline in lost of follow-up, 22% of the children reduced their SDS-BMI after 6 months, 15% after 12 months, and 7% after 24 months, but only in 24,17, and 8% of children, respectively, complete data were available. In the five treatment centers with the best outcome (518 patients), 83% of the children reduced their overweight after 6 months, 67% after 12 months, and 51 % after 24 months. Under real-life conditions, most treatment centers cannot prove the long-term efficacy of their interventions due to high drop-out rate or lack of documentation. Conversely, some institutions achieved a reduction of overweight in nearly the half of their patients 24 months after baseline demonstrating the great heterogeneity in outcome. To improve the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in real-life studying, the process and structure quality as well as their long-term results is urgently needed.

AB  - The hereditary basis of dyslexia makes it possible to identify children at risk early on. Pre-reading children genetically at risk received during 14 weeks a home- and computer-based training in phonemic awareness and letter-sound relationships in the context of reading instruction. At posttest training effects were found for both phonemic awareness and letter knowledge. Trained at-risk children (n=31) made more progress than untrained at-risk controls (n=26) and kept up with untrained not-at-risk controls (n=16). However, the headstart of the trained group did not affect beneficially first and second grade reading and spelling proficiency. Following the start of phonics-based instruction at school, the trained at-risk children could not be discriminated from the untrained at-risk controls, and they were delayed relative to the not-at-risk controls. In order to promote long-term benefits and prevent undoing the advantage of early intervention, delivery should be both home- and school-based and more effort needs to be put in throughout first grade.

AB  - Responsiveness-to-intervention (RTI) is a method for both preventing and helping to identify learning disabilities. An important feature is its multi-tier structure: primary intervention (tier 1) refers to classroom instruction; secondary intervention (tier 2) usually involves more intensive pullout, small-group instruction; and tertiary intervention (tier 3) typically denotes most intensive special education. Despite RTI's popularity and promise, there are many questions about how to implement it effectively and efficiently. So, in 2001, the Office of Special Education Programs in the U.S. Department of Education funded the National Research Center on Learning Disabilities to conduct two large-scale, field-based, longitudinal, and experimental RTI studies. Both studies, one in reading and one in math, were conducted at first grade, with annual follow up for 3 years in the reading study and 2 years in the math study. This article summarizes findings from the reading study, which was designed to answer three basic questions about RTI's pivotal secondary intervention: Who should participate in it? What instruction should be conducted to decrease the prevalence of reading disabilities? How should responsiveness and non-responsiveness be defined?

AB  - Purpose: The Strong African American Families program, a universal intervention to deter alcohol use among rural African American preadolescents, was evaluated to determine whether it also prevented conduct problems across the 29 months separating the pretest and long-term follow-up assessments. The program is based on a contextual model in which intervention effects on parental behavior and youth protective factors are hypothesized to lead to behavior changes. Methods: African American 11-year-olds (N = 667) and their primary caregivers were randomly selected from public school lists of fifth-grade students and randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 369) or control (n = 298) condition. Intervention families participated in a 7-week family skills training program designed to deter alcohol use. Each meeting included separate, concurrent sessions for parents and children, followed by a joint parent-child session during which the families practiced the skills they learned in their separate sessions. Control families were mailed leaflets regarding early adolescent development, stress management, and exercise. All families completed in-home pretest, posttest, and long-term follow-up interviews during which parent-report and self-report data regarding conduct problems, low self-control, deviance-prone peer affiliations, parenting, and youth protective processes were gathered. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that prevention-group youth were less involved than control-group youth in conduct problems across time. As hypothesized, prevention effects were stronger for youth at greater risk of developing conduct problems. Intervention targeted parenting and youth factors partially accounted for intervention effects among high risk youth. Conclusions: Although the Strong African American Families program was designed to deter underage drinking, it is also effective in preventing the development of conduct problems.

AB  - Examined the effectiveness of a school-based prevention program on reducing binge drinking in a sample of minority, inner-city, middle-school students. Rates of binge drinking were compared among 1,713 youths who received the program beginning in the 7th grade 9n = 1,713) and acontrol group (n = 1,328) that did not. The prevention program had protective effects in terms of binge drinking at the 1-year (8th grade) and 2-year (9th grade) follow-up assessments. The proportion of binge drinkers was over 50% lower in the intervention group relative to the control group at the follow-up assessments. There were also several significant program effects on proximal drinking variables, including drinking knowledge, pro-drinking attitudes, and peer drinking norms. These findings indicate that a school-based drug abuse prevention approach previously found to be effective among White youth significantly reduced binge drinking among urban minority youth.

AB  - Objective: Social influences to drink are important predictors of adolescent drinking. This study explored a social influence model of drinking among inner-city adolescents. We examined the role of family drinking and perceived drinking norms in predicting 1-year follow-up perceived social benefits of drinking and the relationship of perceived social benefits of drinking with 2-year follow-up adolescent drinking. Method: Participants in the present study were from the control schools of a randomized trial investigating the etiology and prevention of adolescent alcohol use. During a class period at baseline in seventh grade, participants completed a questionnaire that measured self-reported alcohol use and potential predictors. The panel sample consisted of 1,318 students from baseline (seventh grade), 1-year follow-up (eighth grade), and 2-year follow-up (ninth grade). Results: Structural equation modeling found that both family drinking and perceived drinking norms affected the perceived benefits of drinking. In turn, the perceived benefits of drinking predicted subsequent drinking, controlling for earlier drinking. Conclusions: These results illuminate the importance of the perceived benefits of drinking, as well as social influences to drink, in adolescent drinking. Therefore, they should be incorporated into alcohol prevention programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Smoking rates are projected to increase substantially in developing countries such as South Africa. Purpose: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of two contrasting approaches to school-based smoking prevention in South African youth compared to the standard health education program. One experimental program was based on a skills training/peer resistance model and the other on a harm minimization model. Method: Thirty-six public schools from two South African provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, were stratified by socioeconomic status and randomized to one of three groups. Group 1 (comparison) schools (n = 12) received usual tobacco use education. Group 2 schools (n = 12) received a harm minimization curriculum in grades 8 and 9. Group 3 schools (n = 12) received a life skills training curriculum in grades 8 and 9. The primary outcome was past month use of cigarettes based on a self-reported questionnaire. Result: Five thousand two hundred sixty-six students completed the baseline survey. Of these, 4,684 (89%) completed at least one follow-up assessment. The net change in 30-day smoking from baseline to 2-year followup in the control group was 6% compared to 3% in both harm minimization (HM) and life skills training (LST) schools. These differences were not statistically significant. Intervention response was significantly moderated by both gender and race. The HM intervention was more effective for males, whereas the life skills intervention was more effective for females. For black African students, the strongest effect was evident for the HM intervention, whereas the strongest intervention effect for "colored" students was evident for the LST group. Conclusion: The two experimental curricula both produced similar overall reductions in smoking prevalence that were not significantly different from each other or the control group. However, the impact differed by gender and race, suggesting a need to tailor tobacco and drug use prevention programs. More intensive intervention, in the classroom and beyond, may be needed to further impact smoking behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors studied a longitudinal English intervention in a 70/30 (Spanish/English) developmental bilingual education (DBE) program (n = 302) and compared this model with a typical-practice, 80/20, late-exit transitional bilingual education program (n = 187) in terms of students' language and literacy acquisition from kindergarten to second grade in an urban school district in southeastern Texas. The findings revealed significant differences (p values < .05) in favor of DBE students on (a) English measures of oral language, preliteracy skills, and reading fluency and comprehension (effect sizes of .12 to .71) and (b) Spanish measures of letter name and sound, preliteracy skills, and reading comprehension (effect sizes of .19 to .38). It was concluded that quality English instruction that incorporates direct and focused instruction, context-embedded vocabulary learning, and ongoing professional training in DBE programs is much needed to promote bilingualism and biliteracy.

AB  - This study examines the classroom experiences of 192 children followed longitudinally from kindergarten to 1st grade. Time-sampled observations of children were conducted to compare learning formats, teaching activities, and children's engagement in activities between kindergarten and 1st grade. Classroom observations also were conducted to examine differences in classroom quality; specifically, teacher sensitivity and instructional and emotional support for learning. Results from paired t-tests show that instructional activities become more teacher-directed and structured in 1st grade, children in 1st grade are exposed to less academic instruction than children in kindergarten, but children in 1st grade are more actively engaged in activities than children in kindergarten. With respect to classroom quality, kindergarten and 1st-grade classrooms were similar in terms of teacher sensitivity and emotional support for learning. Instructional support for learning, including instructional conversations, evaluative feedback, and child responsibility, decreased from kindergarten to 1st grade. These findings point to both stability and change in children's classroom experiences across kindergarten and 1st grade and are discussed in terms of the ways in which instructional activities in the classroom and children's achievement can be enhanced in early childhood classrooms.

AB  - Summarizes the implementation of the phonological skills intervention in kindergarten (reported in R. O'Connor et al, 1996) and discusses the long-term (end of 1st grade) effects of that intervention. The Ss were 80 of the 90 children from the original treatment and control classes and 16 of the 17 children in the self-contained special education kindergartens. The children with disabilities included 17 with learning disabilities ([LD],8 in integrated and 9 in self-contained settings), 12 with mild mental retardation ([MMR] 6 in integrated and 6 in self-contained settings), and 2 with serious emotional disturbances (both in self-contained kindergartens). Ss were observed during reading instruction for several months. Ss' 1st grade literacy was evaluated with measures tapping phonological awareness, letter knowledge, reading regular and irregular words, reading fluency, and spelling. For children without disabilities, the early effects of treatment were no longer evident. For children with LD and MMR, the treatment continued to show significant effects on standardized measures of reading and writing and on oral reading fluency and spelling. The effects were equivalent regardless of the setting in which the children received kindergarten instruction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A 12-grade follow-up afforded the opportunity to assess the long-term effects of substance abuse prevention delivered in 6th and 7th grades. A social pressures resistance skills curriculum implemented by classroom teachers had been evaluated with short-term positive results. Students completed self-administered questionnaires at 6th-grade pre- and posttests, and at 7th- and 12th-grade posttests. Curriculum group students received lessons on alcohol, tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless), marijuana, and cocaine, which were later incorporated into the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health Education. This evaluation used data from 262 students who completed all 4 questionnaires and who received the complete 2-yr intervention or no intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated that significant effects evident at 7th grade for alcohol use and misuse, as well as cigarette, cocaine, and other drug use were generally not maintained through 12th grade. Ongoing reinforcement of effective prevention is recommended. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper aims to determine the effect of conceptual change texts accompanied with computer animations on 11th grade students’ understanding and alternative conceptions related to chemical bonding. One experimental group (EG; N = 28) and one comparison group (CG; N = 30) were used in the study. While the comparison group taught traditional instruction, the experimental group received conceptual change text accompanied with computer animations instruction. Chemical bonding achievement test was applied as pre-test, post-test and delayed test to collect data. The results of the study indicated that while there is no statistically significant difference between groups in pre-test, performance of EG students is greater than the CG ones in post-test and delayed test. And also, the EG students are better in remediating their alternative conceptions related to chemical bonding. Based on the study, it is concluded that conceptual change texts combined with computer animations can be effective instructional tools to improve students’ conceptual understanding of chemical concepts.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of different versions of Web-based instruction focused on text structure on fifth- and seventh-grade students' reading comprehension. Stratified random assignment was employed in a two-factor experiment embedded within a pretest and multiple posttests design (immediate and four-month delayed posttests). The two factors were type of feedback provided by the Web-based tutor (elaborated vs. simple feedback) and the motivational factor of choice of text topics in practice lessons (student choice of texts vs. no choice). These factors were examined to learn how they affected performance after the six-month, 90-minutes/week intervention. Students who received elaborated feedback performed better on a standardized test of reading comprehension than students who received simple feedback. Learning how to attend to errors from the elaborated feedback tutor yielded large gains in test performance. Simple feedback did not help the least skilled third of readers move from complete lack of competency to competency using the structure strategy with problem-and-solution text. Choice between two topics for practice lessons did not increase reading comprehension. Substantial effect sizes were found from pretest to posttest on various measures of reading comprehension: recall, strategy competence, and standardized reading comprehension test scores. Maintenance of performance over summer break was found for most measures. The study informs research and teaching about Web-based reading tutors, feedback, comprehension, and top-level text structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Focus on Kids (FOK), a sexual risk reduction intervention, shown to be effective among urban, African-American adolescents living in communities with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, in reducing sexual risk behaviors among rural, white adolescents living in communities with low rates of sexually transmitted diseases. The subjects were 1,131 youth ages 12 to 16 years from 12 rural counties in West Virginia. Method: The study was a randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial of a theory-based prevention intervention. Outcomes included self-reported sexual behaviors and perceptions assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months after intervention. Results: At baseline, 21% of youth were sexually experienced; 80% reported using a condom at last episode of intercourse. Rates of behaviors did not differ based on intervention assignment (FOK vs control group) after adjusting for baseline differences at any follow-up period among the full cohort or among the subset of youth who completed the intervention curriculum to which they were assigned. Perceptions of risk and protective behaviors were positively influenced by FOK at 3, 6, and 9 months in a fashion consistent with the guiding model of behavioral change and the FOK curriculum. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies of FOK in high-risk urban areas, some perceptions were positively altered by FOK in these rural areas, although many of these changes did not persist through 9 months of follow-up. In contrast to previous studies, self-reported sexual risk behaviors did not decrease among FOK youth. FOK was not associated with any increases in sexual risk behaviors.

AB  - The authors report 1-year follow-up data from 215 English language learners with reading difficulties who received a supplemental first grade reading intervention in the language of their core reading instruction. The researchers provided no intervention or boosters in second grade. The Spanish study revealed significant differences favoring treatment students on Spanish measures of decoding, spelling, fluency, and comprehension (median d = 0.53). Similar results were evidenced in the English study, with significant differences favoring treatment students on English measures of oral language, decoding, spelling, fluency, and comprehension (median d = 0.40). Few direct transfer effects were noted for either language. The first grade intervention was associated with stronger skills in a variety of literacy-related domains 1 year after its termination.

AB  - Using data from the first and the second National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS): 88 follow-up studies, this study examined the differential impact of reform and traditional types of instruction on the mathematics performance and attitudes of Black and Hispanic 10th, 11th and 12th grade students. Findings from this sampled group showed that 12th grade students receiving reform instruction had a significantly higher achievement score than students receiving traditional instruction. Also, 10th grade students with better attitudes toward mathematics had a significantly higher achievement score than those with poorer attitudes towards mathematics. In addition, students with good attitudes toward mathematics in the 10th grade achieved better mathematics scores in 12th grade. Practical implications, suggestions for future research, and implications for the Talent Development Secondary School Project are discussed.
